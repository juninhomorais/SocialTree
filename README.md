<h1>SocialTree</h1>

Challenge created by Rocketseat :purple_heart:

The objective of this challenge was to create a simple HTML/CSS page aimed at social networks, with the focus of centralizing all communication channels and redirecting it to their respective locations.

We use a structure with few codes, trying to make it as simple as possible for any lay user to manage and update it.

In addition to all the necessary base, we use some knowledge such as:

<ul>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>CSS variables</li>
</ul>
